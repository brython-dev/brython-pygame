'''Pygame module for interacting with events and queues.

Pygame handles all it's event messaging through an event queue. The routines
in this module help you manage that event queue. The input queue is heavily
dependent on the pygame display module. If the display has not been
initialized and a video mode not set, the event queue will not really work.
 
The queue is a regular queue of Event objects, there are a variety of ways
to access the events it contains. From simply checking for the existance of
events, to grabbing them directly off the stack.
 
All events have a type identifier. This event type is in between the values
of NOEVENT and NUMEVENTS. All user defined events can have the value of
USEREVENT or higher. It is recommended make sure your event id's follow this
system.
 
To get the state of various input devices, you can forego the event queue
and access the input devices directly with their appropriate modules; mouse,
key, and joystick. If you use this method, remember that pygame requires some
form of communication with the system window manager and other parts of the
platform. To keep pygame in synch with the system, you will need to call
pygame.event.pump() to keep everything current. You'll want to call this
function usually once per game loop.
 
The event queue offers some simple filtering. This can help performance
slightly by blocking certain event types from the queue, use the
pygame.event.set_allowed() and pygame.event.set_blocked() to work with
this filtering. All events default to allowed.
 
Joysticks will not send any events until the device has been initialized.

An Event object contains an event type and a readonly set of member data.
The Event object contains no method functions, just member data. Event
objects are retrieved from the pygame event queue. You can create your
own new events with the pygame.event.Event() function.

Your program must take steps to keep the event queue from overflowing. If the
program is not clearing or getting all events off the queue at regular
intervals, it can overflow.  When the queue overflows an exception is thrown.
 
All Event objects contain an event type identifier in the Event.type member.
You may also get full access to the Event's member data through the Event.dict
method. All other member lookups will be passed through to the Event's
dictionary values.
 
While debugging and experimenting, you can print the Event objects for a
quick display of its type and members. Events that come from the system
will have a guaranteed set of member items based on the type. Here is a
list of the Event members that are defined with each type.

def pump():
    '''Internally process pygame event handlers.

    For each frame of your game, you will need to make some sort of call to
    the event queue. This ensures your program can internally interact with
    the rest of the operating system. If you are not using other event
    functions in your game, you should call pygame.event.pump() to allow
    pygame to handle internal actions.

    This function is not necessary if your program is consistently processing
    events on the queue through the other pygame.event functions.
     
    There are important things that must be dealt with internally in the event
    queue. The main window may need to be repainted or respond to the system.
    If you fail to make a call to the event queue for too long, the system may
    decide your program has locked up.
