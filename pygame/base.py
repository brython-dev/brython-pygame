'''Pygame core routines

Contains the core routines that are used by the rest of the
pygame modules. Its routines are merged directly into the pygame
namespace. This mainly includes the auto-initialization `init` and
`quit` routines.

There is a small module named `locals` that also gets merged into
this namespace. This contains all the constants needed by pygame.
Object constructors also get placed into this namespace, you can
call functions like `Rect` and `Surface` to create objects of
that type. As a convenience, you can import the members of
pygame.locals directly into your module's namespace with::

    from pygame.locals import *
    
Most of the pygame examples do this if you'd like to take a look.

def init():
    '''Autoinitialize all imported pygame modules.

    Initialize all imported pygame modules. Includes pygame modules
    that are not part of the base modules (like font and image).

    It does not raise exceptions, but instead silently counts which
    modules have failed to init. The return argument contains a count
    of the number of modules initialized, and the number of modules
    that failed to initialize.

    You can always initialize the modules you want by hand. The
    modules that need it have an `init` and `quit` routine built in,
    which you can call directly. They also have a `get_init` routine
    which you can use to doublecheck the initialization. Note that
    the manual `init` routines will raise an exception on error. Be
    aware that most platforms require the display module to be
    initialized before others. This `init` will handle that for you,
    but if you initialize by hand, be aware of this constraint.

    As with the manual `init` routines. It is safe to call this
    `init` as often as you like.
